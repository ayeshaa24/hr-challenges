# Topics:
## Actual algorithms:
- Graph Theory: BFS (Breadth First Search), DFS (Depth First Search)

## Algorithms:
- The Grid Search: *slicing*
- Cut The Sticks: slicing, sorting, counting
- Encryption: slicing, ceil
- Modified Kaprekar Numbers: slicing, counting
- Halloween Sale: counting
- The Time In Words: if, replace, time, logic shortcuts...
- Lisa's workbook: loops, counting
- Flatland Space Stations: counting
- Happy Ladybugs: counting, checking order
- Caesar Cipher: ciphers, ord, chr
- Cavity Map: treating arrays as grids, if statements

## Interview: Dictionaries
- Ransom Note: defaultdict, counting
- Two Strings: sets...?
- Sherlock And Anagrams: dictionaries, counting, tuples/sorted, anagrams
- Frequency Queries: dictionaries, reverse lookup!!!

## Interview: Recursion
- Fibonacci Numbers
- Davis' Staircase: recursion, 'cache', linear recurrences, matrices (??)
- Recursive Digit Sum: recursion...fiddly 0_o memory errors

## Interview: String Manipulation
- Making Anagrams: dictionaries/counting
- Alternating Characters: counting
- Sherlock and The Valid String: counter, min, max
- Special String Again: regex, +/- lookahead, capture groups, triangle numbers
- Common Child: longest common subsequence...

## Interview: Sorting
- Bubble Sort
- Mark and Toys: sort function, counting
- Fraudulent Activity Notification: counting sort (sort of), queue


## Interview: Greedy Algorithms
An algorithm that follows the approach of making the logically optimal choice
at each stage. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm
- Minimum Absolute Difference In An Array: sorting
- Luck Balance: sorting
- Greedy Florist: sorting, integer division
- Max Min: sorting

## Interview: Search
- Ice Cream Parlour: dictionary, two sum https://leetcode.com/articles/two-sum/
- Pairs: counter, alt has set and set intersection tho
- Triple Sum: sorting, counters and while loops, that logic tho...
- Minimum Time Required: binary search sort of, counter, ceil

## Interview: Trees
- Height of a Binary Tree: max, recursion
- Lowest Common Ancestor: recursion/while loop, BST, comparison, min, max
- Huffman Decoding

## Interview: Stacks and Queues
- Balanced Brackets: stack, creating dict using list comprehension and zip
- A Tale of Two Stacks: two stacks to make a queue cos why not, -1 indexing

## Interview: Graphs:
- Shortest Reach In A Graph: BFS, classes
- Connected Cell In A Grid: DFS, class, dictionary, try/except, recursion
- Find The Nearest Clone: BFS/DFS...? classes

## Interview: Dynamic Programming
- Max Array Sum: dynamic programming, max, non-adjacent
- Abbreviation: dynamic programming!!!!

## Modulus:
- Non-Divisible Sets
- Fair Rations: even/odd

## Regex:
- Special String Again: lookahead, capture groups

## Classes:
- Trees generally?
- BFS: Shortest Reach In A Graph
- DFS: Connected Cell In A Grid

## Recursion:
- Connected Cell In A Grid
